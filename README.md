# Neural-Machine-Translation

Here, we build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25"). It is done by using an attention model which is one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models.

The model used here could be used to translate from one language to another, such as translating from English to Hindi. However, language translation requires massive datasets and usually takes days of training on GPUs.
